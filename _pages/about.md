Welcome! and thank you for visiting my page!

I'm Sohan Costa, a Research assistant and Graduate student in the final stages of my Ph.D. in Physics at UTK. I work under the supervision of Prof. Steven Johnston in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. I earned my Master's degree in physics from UTK and hold a B.Sc.(special) in Engineering Physics from the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka.

My research focused on strongly-correlated matter, which I study using toy models and advanced numerical methods such as the determinant quantum Monte Carlo(DQMC) method. I also use machine learning (ML) techniques to accelerate simulations, identifying phase transitions, and uncovering physical phenomena that emerge in strongly correlated systems. Broadly, my interests include the theoretical and computational study of 1D and 2D systems, layered and bilayer materials, and the application of ML-enhanced numerical methods to advance our understanding of strongly correlated matter.
